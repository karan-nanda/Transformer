## Introduction

The Transformer model is a state-of-the-art architecture that has outperformed traditional sequence-to-sequence models in various NLP tasks. This repository provides a PyTorch implementation of the Transformer model, including its core components:

- Self-attention mechanism
- Multi-head attention
- Positional encoding
- Layer normalization
- Encoder and decoder components
- Feed-forward networks

This codebase is designed to be modular and flexible, making it suitable for various sequence-to-sequence tasks, including machine translation and text generation.

## Key Features

- Modular implementation of the Transformer architecture.
- Support for customizable model hyperparameters.
- Detailed documentation and comments to help you understand and modify the code.
- Easy-to-use functions for building and training Transformer models for your specific task.

## Usage

To use this implementation of the Transformer model, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Prepare your dataset and data preprocessing code. Ensure that your data is formatted correctly for training and evaluation.

3. Customize the hyperparameters and model architecture in your Python script or Jupyter notebook. You can use the provided build_transformer function to create a Transformer model with your desired settings.

4. Train your Transformer model using the provided training code. The training code includes functionality for loading and preprocessing your dataset, defining the model, optimizing it, and saving checkpoints.

5. Evaluate your trained model on your specific task, such as machine translation or text generation. You can use the provided evaluation code to measure performance metrics.

6. Modify and adapt the code as needed for your specific use case. You can experiment with different model configurations, hyperparameters, and data preprocessing steps.

## Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run this code:

Python 3.6+
PyTorch
NumPy
Other libraries as specified in the requirements.txt file

## Training
To train your Transformer model, you can use the provided training code located in the train_model.py script. Follow these steps to train your model:

Configure your training settings in the config.py file. Specify the dataset source, target languages, model hyperparameters, and other training-related parameters.

Run the training script:

``` bash
python train_model.py
```
This script will load and preprocess your dataset, train the model, and save checkpoints at the end of each epoch.

Monitor the training progress using TensorBoard or other logging tools. You can visualize training loss and other metrics during training.

Evaluate your trained model on a validation dataset using the evaluation code provided in the train_model.py script. This will help you assess the model's performance.

Save the final trained model checkpoint for later use or deployment.

## Dataset

The dataset used for the language conversion model was derived from the HuggingFace library called 'opus_books' which is available [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/opus_books/viewer/en-it/train). Although you do not need to download the data as it can be imported or downloaded through HuggingFace's API server
